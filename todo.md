# Subdomain Extraction and Port Scanning Script - Todo List

## Project Setup
- [x] Create project directory structure

## Subdomain Extraction Script
- [x] Research and select appropriate libraries for subdomain extraction
- [x] Create function to read domain list from input file
- [x] Implement subdomain extraction functionality
- [x] Add error handling for failed extractions
- [x] Create function to save extracted subdomains to file

## Port Scanning Script
- [x] Research and select appropriate libraries for port scanning
- [x] Create function to read domain/subdomain list
- [x] Implement port scanning functionality with configurable ports
- [x] Add timeout and error handling for scanning
- [x] Create function to save port scan results to file

## Main Script Integration
- [x] Create main script that combines subdomain extraction and port scanning
- [x] Implement command-line argument parsing
- [x] Add configuration options (threads, timeout, ports to scan)
- [x] Implement proper logging and progress reporting

## Testing
- [x] Create sample domain list for testing
- [x] Test subdomain extraction functionality
- [x] Test port scanning functionality
- [x] Test integrated script with sample data
- [x] Verify output format and accuracy

## Optimization and Finalization
- [x] Optimize for performance (parallel processing)
- [x] Add rate limiting to avoid being blocked
- [x] Review and refactor code for readability
- [x] Add comments and docstrings

## Documentation
- [x] Create README with installation instructions
- [x] Document usage examples
- [x] Document output format
- [x] List dependencies and requirements

## Delivery
- [x] Package all scripts and documentation
- [x] Deliver final solution to user

## Certificate-Based Subdomain Extraction Enhancement
- [x] Research crt.sh API and certificate transparency logs
- [x] Implement certificate-based subdomain extraction function
- [x] Integrate with existing subdomain extraction workflow
- [x] Add command-line option to enable/disable certificate-based extraction
- [x] Implement deduplication of results from multiple sources

## Enhanced Testing
- [x] Test certificate-based extraction functionality
- [x] Test integrated workflow with both extraction methods
- [x] Verify combined results accuracy

## Documentation Update
- [x] Update README with certificate-based extraction information
- [x] Add usage examples for the new functionality
- [x] Update command-line options documentation

## Final Delivery
- [x] Package updated scripts and documentation
- [x] Deliver enhanced solution to user
